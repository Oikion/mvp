# Email Template Conventions

## Structure

- All email templates are React components using React Email
- Base layout: extend `BaseLayout` from `emails/components/BaseLayout.tsx`
- Admin emails: `emails/admin/` (account management, platform notifications)
- Notification emails: `emails/notifications/` (CRM, calendar, deals, social)
- Email service: Resend via `@/lib/resend`

## Template Pattern

```typescript
import { BaseLayout } from "../components/BaseLayout";
import { Text, Section, Button } from "@react-email/components";

interface MyEmailProps {
  recipientName: string;
  // ... other props
}

export default function MyEmail({ recipientName }: MyEmailProps) {
  return (
    <BaseLayout>
      <Section>
        <Text>Hello {recipientName},</Text>
        {/* Email content */}
        <Button href="https://app.oikion.gr/...">
          View Details
        </Button>
      </Section>
    </BaseLayout>
  );
}
```

## Conventions

- Support both Greek and English content where applicable
- Keep templates simple — email clients have limited CSS support
- Use inline styles (React Email handles this via components)
- Test with Resend preview before deploying to production
- Avoid complex layouts — stick to single-column, mobile-friendly designs
- Always include a plain text fallback
- Link URLs should be absolute (include full domain)

## Existing Templates

Reference these for patterns:
- `emails/notifications/ClientCreated.tsx` — Simple notification
- `emails/notifications/CalendarEventInvited.tsx` — Event with action button
- `emails/notifications/DealProposed.tsx` — Complex multi-section email
- `emails/admin/AccountSuspension.tsx` — Admin notification
- `emails/Welcome.tsx` — Onboarding email
