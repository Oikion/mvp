## Known Issues & Limitations

### Type Safety
- 50 files use `@ts-nocheck` for type checking bypass
- Type safety improvements planned for v1.1.0+
- See `docs/development/type-safety-roadmap.md`

### Logging
- Console-based logging in production
- Structured logging planned for v1.1.0
- See `docs/development/logging-strategy.md`

### Features
- Calendar functionality is internal (Cal.com deprecated)
- Mobile app not available (web-responsive only)
- API v1 is in beta (breaking changes possible)
- Some features require manual configuration

### Performance
- Database indexes may need optimization under load
- Connection pooling configured but may need tuning
- See `docs/optimization/README.md`

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- ✅ Database migrations tested
- ✅ Authentication flows verified
- ✅ Data isolation working correctly
- ✅ API rate limiting configured

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ Type safety issues documented but not fixed
- ⚠️ Performance under high load not fully tested
- ⚠️ External service dependencies (Clerk, Ably, etc.)

### Low Risk
- ℹ️ Console logging in production (intentional)
- ℹ️ Some features require manual setup
- ℹ️ API v1 may have breaking changes

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous stable version
2. **Database**: Restore from backup if needed
3. **Communication**: Notify users of the issue
4. **Fix**: Address the critical issue
5. **Redeploy**: Deploy fixed version
6. **Verify**: Confirm issue is resolved
7. **Post-mortem**: Document what went wrong
